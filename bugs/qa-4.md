# Bug [#4](https://github.com/amosnjoroge/buckhill-qa-automation-eng-task/issues/13): Product Images of the First Category on the Landing Page Are Not Displayed

## Description

On the landing page of the Pet Shop application, the product images for the first category are not being displayed. The reason for this issue is that the first products backend request's response metadata does not include the values for the and image uuid. As a result, the images are not loading and are failing to display. This issue affects the visual presentation of the landing page and hampers the user's ability to view and select products from the first category.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate to the Pet Shop application's landing page.
2. Locate the first product category section.
3. Observe the product images and the products.

## Expected Behavior

Product images associated with the first category should be displayed within the designated section on the landing page. The images should help users identify and select products to explore further.

## Actual Behavior

The product images for the first category on the landing page are not visible due to the absence of image UUIDs and metadata information of the returned products request. This leads to an incomplete and unappealing presentation of the products, making it challenging for users to engage with the content.
